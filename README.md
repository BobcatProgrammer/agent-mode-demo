# Agent Mode Demo - Calculator

This is a simple calculator app running in CLI. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It works by parsing user input and performing the requested operation.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚ûï Addition
- ‚ûñ Subtraction
- ‚úñÔ∏è Multiplication
- ‚ûó Division

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Each operation is now its own command. Run the application as follows:

```sh
python calculator.py add 5 3
# Result: 8
python calculator.py subtract 10 4
# Result: 6
python calculator.py multiply 2 3
# Result: 6
python calculator.py divide 8 2
# Result: 4.0
```

## üß™ Running Tests

```sh
python -m unittest test_calculator.py
```

## üß© Technology Stack

- Python 3.x
- [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) for CLI
- Unit tests to verify
- Easy to use CLI interface

## üí° Prompts to try

```
I want to update our calculator.py so that the divide function handles division by zero gracefully (by returning None instead of raising an exception). Also, update the corresponding unit test in test_calculator.py to check this new behavior.
```
